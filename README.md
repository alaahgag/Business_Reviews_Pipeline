# Yelp Business Review Data Pipeline

# Overview

The Yelp Business Review Data Pipeline is a comprehensive solution for processing and analyzing Yelp business review data. This end-to-end data pipeline integrates various technologies, including Python, Kafka, AWS services (DynamoDB, S3, Redshift), PySpark, AWS Lambda, and Power BI. The project enables real-time streaming, change data capture (CDC), daily batch processing, and data visualization to gain insights into customer sentiment, business performance, and industry trends.

# Introduction
Our big data project revolves around processing and analyzing Yelp business review data. The pipeline handles real-time streaming, CDC, daily batch processing, and data visualization. The key data sources include three main tables from Yelp's dataset: Business, Reviews, and Users, providing valuable information about businesses, customer reviews, and user details.


# Key Components

### Kafka on Premise

Used for real-time data streaming.
Producers ingest data from JSON and CSV files.
Topics created for each table (Business, Reviews, Users) for organized data streams.

### Python Producers

Python scripts serve as producers for streaming data into Kafka topics.
Continuous ingestion of Yelp dataset into the Kafka cluster.

### PySpark Consumer

Implemented using PySpark to process and transform incoming data from Kafka.
Enriches data and prepares it for storage in DynamoDB.

### DynamoDB

NoSQL database for real-time storage of processed Yelp data.
AWS Lambda Triggers in DynamoDB configured for CDC processes.

### AWS Lambda Triggers

Functions trigger CDC processes in DynamoDB on data changes.
Captures and propagates changes to an S3 bucket for daily batch processing.

### S3 Batch Processing

Daily batch processing on data stored in S3 for aggregation, cleaning, and transformation.
Processed data made ready for loading into the Redshift data warehouse.

### Redshift Data Warehouse

Central data warehouse for storing Yelp data in a structured and optimized format.
Daily batches of processed data from S3 loaded for analytical queries.

### Power BI Dashboard

Utilized for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards and reports.
Direct queries to Redshift for real-time visualization and analysis.

# Workflow

### Real-time Streaming

Yelp data continuously streamed in real-time from JSON and CSV files into Kafka topics.

### PySpark Data Processing

PySpark jobs in the Kafka consumer process and transform incoming data before uploading it to DynamoDB.

### Change Data Capture (CDC)

AWS Lambda Triggers in DynamoDB capture changes in real-time, ensuring data consistency.

### S3 Batch Processing

Daily batches of data from DynamoDB processed and transformed in S3 for optimal analytics.

### Redshift Data Loading

Processed data loaded daily into Redshift for historical and analytical queries.

### Power BI Data Visualization

Power BI connected to Redshift for real-time queries, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards and reports.

# Benefits

### Real-time Data Insights

Leveraged Kafka and PySpark for real-time data streaming and processing, providing immediate insights into Yelp data.

### Scalable and Flexible

AWS services (DynamoDB, S3, Redshift) offered scalability and flexibility to handle growing data volumes and analytical needs.

### Change Data Capture

Implemented CDC in DynamoDB using Lambda Triggers for capturing and propagating real-time data changes.

### Daily Batch Processing

Utilized S3 for efficient daily batch processing, ensuring data is optimized for Redshift.

### Data Visualization

Power BI employed for creating visually appealing and interactive dashboards for easy data exploration and analysis.
